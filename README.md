# Weekly-Challenge-2
## 1.Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor existing code to expand the dataset of 2017 and 2018 stock market which existed seperately. Additionally, since the size of the dataset was smaller in previous codes, re-examination of this refactored code will be another purpose. This process is done in a similar path with the existing code, but combined. The data contains ticker, total daily volume and return (Ending price/Starting price - 1) and return will be colored as previous dataset were. 
## 2. Result
### Performance between 2017 & 2018

### Execution time 
Execution time of refactor code of 2017 is 0.4921875 and 0.3320313 at 2018
Original script shows 0 seconds for both 2017 and 2018, but it isn't significant regard to the size of the dataset that refactor code process with. 
## 3. Summary
### 1.What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Advantages of refactoring code are time saving, organized code and maintaining previous code. Refactoring simply is time saving because structuring whole code from the begining takes much more time than refactoring it. We can use existing structure with the new variables by adding some context in it. The other advantage is organized code after refactoring. It will eventually provide more cleaner and organized code to view and to understand since it has gone through twice. Last advantage could be maintaining existing code which could be lost as time goes by. 
Disadvantages of refactoring is potential mistake and the fact that it could be time consuming. Both of those disadvantages occurs when it comes to dealing with codes from other person which makes it difficult to fully understand the intention of each code. Those mistakes results the work be more time consuming ironically. 
### 2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
All the pros and cons have one premise which is the one who wrote the code should be the person himself or someone who have full understanding about following code. If this is the case, disadvantages of refactoring the original VBA script could be reduced and if its not, then the advantages will become disadvantages resulting spending more time to refactoring the script.
