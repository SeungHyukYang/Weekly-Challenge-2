# Weekly-Challenge-2
## 1.Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor existing code to expand the dataset of 2017 and 2018 stock market which existed seperately. Additionally, since the size of the dataset was smaller in previous codes, re-examination of this refactored code will be another purpose. This process is done in a similar path with the existing code, but combined. The data contains ticker, total daily volume and return (Ending price/Starting price - 1) and return will be colored as previous dataset were.
